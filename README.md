## RFM Analysis
*There is a positive correlation between RFM total score and Revenue.*

- The amount spent per customer ranges from ($21) to upwards of ($29,938).
- **Recency Score:** The majority of customers have a score of 2, 3, 4. These customers also show higher revenue totals. 
- **Frequency Score:** The majority of customers have a frequency score of 3, 2, 1. Customers with a frequency score of 3 and 2 have the highest revenue totals.
- **Monetary Score:** The highest concentration of data points is at Monetary Score of 2, covering a wide range of revenue values, approximately ($12,000) to ($26,000).
  - No Customers have a monetary score of 3 or 4.
  - Customers at Monetary score 1 mostly generate revenues below $6,000, making them the lowest-performing group.
  - Though fewer in number, Monetary score 5 contains customers generating significant revenue values, peaking around ($22,000).
- **RFM total:** Aside from some outliters geenrating high revenue values with moderate RFM scores, as RFM total score increases so does revenue. 
    - The scatter plot shows a dense cluster of customers with RFM Total scores between 4 and 8, contributing variable revenue from $5,000 to $15,000. 
        - This suggests most customers fall into this range and are likely mid-tier in terms of engagement and spending. 
    - Customers with RFM Total scores below 4 consistently generate lower revenue, ranging from $2,000 to $6,000. These are likely at-risk customers who may churn if not re-engaged.
    - Among high RFM scores (9â€“13), revenue varies significantly from $7,000 to $30,000. 

<h1 align="center">Recommendations </h1>

## 1. Customers
- Increase loyalty program membership from the current 21.72% by:
    - Focusing on converting high-spending segments (e.g., Senior Males).
    - Design segment-specific loyalty offers based on RFM analysis or churned loyalty members.

- Develop targeted marketing strategies for Senior and Middle Age customer segments.
- Develop targeted marketing strategies for young Males who consistently have higher average spending, regardless of loyalty membership indicating that male customers are more likely to spend on higher-ticket items or larger orders.
- Address satisfaction issues, particularly for female non-loyalty members.

- RFM-based
    - Recency score 2, 3, and 4 customers are the most promising segments for driving business growth. These customers are actively purchasing and producing the highest revenue. Concentrating marketing and retention efforts here could maximize ROI.
    - Leverage Frequency score 2 customers' engagement and revenue peaks to scale repeat purchases.
    - Prioritize Monetary score 2 customers, the backbone of revenue, with tailored strategies to maintain their revenue. 
    - Target RFM Total scores 4-8 customers for retention and growth efforts, as they form the majority.
    - Investigate outliers to understand their purchasing behaviors and replicate successful patterns with other customers because they contribute significantly to revenue.
    - Address disengagement among customers with high Recency but low Frequency and Monetary scores through reactivation campaigns.


## 2. Products
- Focus on top-performing SKUs (SMP234, TBL345, SKU1003).
- Further research is needed for severely underperforming (SKU1001) compared to other products.
- Create bundled offerings for Smartphones with popular accessories to leverage their high sales volume.
- Explore bundle deals for SKUs with high add-on potential. (HDP456, LTP123).
- Look into warranty programs for Headphones, which show strong warranty attachment potential.

## 3. Operations
- Optimize inventory and promotions for peak months (January and April).
- Implement targeted promotions during off-peak months (July-September).
- Consider incentives for higher-value payment methods like Bank Transfer and Credit Card to shift traffic from lower AOV methods.
- Promote Expedited and Same-Day Shipping options & investigate pricing and operational costs for Express and Overnight Shipping.
